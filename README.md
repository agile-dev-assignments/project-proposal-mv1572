# Project Proposal: My Meal

### Project title
My Meal: The easiest way to find food near you.

### What is it?
My Meal will be an Android and iOS app which helps users to find and order meals for takeout or delivery. 

### Why do I need it?

During the time of COVID-19 eating at restaurants has become seemingly taboo, if it is even allowed by local governments. With the closure of restaurants, takeout and delivery orders have filled the void of hungry people around the country who just don't feel like cooking. While ordering food eliminates the task of having to actually cook the meal, it presents a new dilemma: How am I going to order my food tonight? My Meal will try to eliminate this diffuclty by combining all of the various delivery and takeout apps into one place. 
### Who am I?
Users of this app will be anyone who is looking to order food, regardless of whether they want takeout or delivery. These users will be looking to move on from switching between Uber Eats, Grubhub, Seamless, etc. and will be looking to find food in one location.

### How will they use it?
Users will be presented with nearby restaurants from which to order. They will have access to things like ratings and menus to try and determine where they would like food from. Once selected, the user will be able to create their order and then select the service which they would like for delivery, with emphasis on that restaurant's own delivery service if one exists. 

### Scope
The project will include creating a database of restaurants which the app is able to access, likely through existing databases on Uber Eats, Grubhub, etc. A database of reviews will also need to be sourced at first, with users able to input and share their own. A friendly and accesbile UX will also be crucial for the apps success, as it cannot become too difficult that users simply switch to a different app. The biggest difficult will likely be the app interacting with already established apps, especially if APIs do not exist.
